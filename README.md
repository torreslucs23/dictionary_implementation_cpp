# University Project: Dictionary Implementation

This project was developed as part of the **Advanced Data Structures** course. It implements a dictionary using multiple data structures, including:

- **AVL Trees**
- **Red-Black Trees**
- **Two types of Hash Tables**

The detailed specifications and explanations of the project can be found in the attached `relatorio.pdf` (report file).

## Project Overview

The dictionary is implemented with a focus on balancing and efficient data retrieval, leveraging different tree structures and hash tables to provide an in-depth comparison of performance and functionality.

### Data Structures Used:

1. **AVL Tree**: A self-balancing binary search tree where the difference between heights of left and right subtrees cannot be more than one for all nodes.
   
2. **Red-Black Tree**: A self-balancing binary search tree with an additional property to ensure the tree remains balanced, improving search, insertion, and deletion times.
   
3. **Hash Tables**: Two variations of hash tables are implemented to explore different hashing techniques and their efficiency in handling dictionary operations.
